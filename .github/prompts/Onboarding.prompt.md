Project Coding Knowledge Base Generation Workflow

<roleContext>
YOU ARE an expert software architect specialized in codebase analysis and technical documentation.
THIS WORKFLOW: Analyzes the provided software project codebase and generates a comprehensive knowledge.coding.md document serving as a technical onboarding guide by delivering systematic project structure analysis with architectural patterns, file structure documentation, and design choice identification with absolute precision.
</roleContext>

<objectives>
<primary>Generate a comprehensive knowledge.coding.md document that serves as a technical onboarding guide for development and architecture</primary>
<secondary>
    <goal>Document architectural patterns, file structure, and design choices with absolute precision</goal>
    <goal>Extract and document development workflow commands for team onboarding</goal>
    <goal>Map cross-cutting concerns and system-wide functionalities</goal>
    <goal>Create objective technical documentation focused on system structure and development practices</goal>
</secondary>
</objectives>

<importantReminders>USE your Todo Management tool to track task progress throughout this entire workflow execution.</importantReminders>

WORKFLOW METHODOLOGY:
1. VALIDATE pre-workflow tasks
2. EXECUTE workflow phases sequentially
3. INTEGRATE post-workflow tasks
</executionFlow>

<preWorkflowTasks>
BEFORE STARTING: EXECUTE these validation and setup tasks in sequence. STOP and Report if any task fails:
    <task title="Create Empty Knowledge Files">
        mkdir -p .github/docs && \
        touch .github/docs/knowledge.coding.md
    </task>
</preWorkflowTasks>

<phases>
EXECUTE the following phases SEQUENTIALLY. COMPLETE each phase entirely before proceeding to the next:
    <phase number="1" name="Architectural Assessment">
        <task id="1.1" title="Overall Architecture Identification">
            ANALYZE the root directory structure. DETERMINE if the project is a monorepo, a monolith, or follows another high-level structural pattern. DOCUMENT the purpose of ALL key top-level directories.
        </task>
        <task id="1.2" title="Shared Code Convention Documentation">
            INVESTIGATE shared code directories. IDENTIFY and DOCUMENT the established patterns and locations for common code, such as utilities, DTOs/interfaces, constants, and core/abstract classes.
        </task>
        <task id="1.3" title="Cross-Cutting Concerns Analysis">
            FIND ALL implementations for system-wide functionalities. DOCUMENT the project's generic approach to logging, exception handling, configuration management, authentication/authorization, and caching. eg: docs folder
        </task>
        <task id="1.4" title="Update knowledge.coding.md">
           UPDATE the knowledge.coding.md file with the documented architectural assessment information.
        </task>
    </phase>
    <phase number="2" name="Application-Level Design Analysis">
        <task id="2.1" title="Application Design Description">
            ANALYZE each individual, runnable project source code structure. DOCUMENT its internal design pattern and the responsibility of its primary folders.
        </task>
        <task id="2.2" title="Update knowledge.coding.md">
           UPDATE the knowledge.coding.md file with the Application-Level Design Analysis.
        </task>
    </phase>
    <phase number="3" name="Infrastructure and Data Mapping">
        <task id="3.1" title="Data and Infrastructure Mapping">
            IDENTIFY all database entity or schema definitions and LIST their names. SCAN the codebase for clients or SDKs connecting to external dependencies and DOCUMENT these integrations.
        </task>
        <task id="3.2" title="Development Workflow Extraction">
            ANALYZE ALL build and script definition files. LIST and DESCRIBE ALL essential commands required for a developer to install dependencies, start the application, run tests, and execute linters.
        </task>
        <task id="3.3" title="Update knowledge.coding.md">
           UPDATE the knowledge.coding.md file with the Infrastructure and Data Mapping and Development Workflow information.
        </task>
    </phase>
</phases>

<postWorkflowTasks>
AFTER COMPLETING all phases: EXECUTE these tasks:
    <task title="Execute Reflection Workflow">
        EXECUTE and READ `cat .github/prompts/reflections/a.onboarding.coding.reflection.md` workflow
    </task>
</postWorkflowTasks>

<constraints>
ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS - NEVER violate these rules:
- NEVER include business-specific logic details
- NEVER count or enumerate specific features or API endpoints
- NEVER include implementation details unrelated to architecture
- ALWAYS focus ONLY on structural and design aspects
- MUST maintain objective, technical tone throughout documentation
</constraints>
