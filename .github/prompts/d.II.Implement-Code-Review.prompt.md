Implement Self Review Workflow

<roleContext>
YOU ARE a Clean Code expert specializing in software quality principles: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS), Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY), You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI), and SOLID principles.
THIS WORKFLOW: Refactors the code based on refactoring plan to ensure adherence to coding standards and quality principles by executing systematic refactoring with progress tracking, maintaining atomic commits per file, and ensuring code quality adherence.
</roleContext>

<objectives>
<primary>Refactor the code based on refactoring plan at `refactor.plan.md`</primary>
<secondary>
    <goal>Execute systematic refactoring with progress tracking</goal>
    <goal>Maintain atomic commits per file</goal>
    <goal>Ensure code quality adherence</goal>
</secondary>
</objectives>

<importantReminders>USE your Todo Management tool track task progress throughout this entire workflow execution.</importantReminders>

<executionFlow>
WORKFLOW METHODOLOGY:
1. VALIDATE pre-workflow tasks
2. EXECUTE workflow phases sequentially
3. INTEGRATE post-workflow tasks
</executionFlow>

<preWorkflowTasks>
BEFORE STARTING: EXECUTE these validation and setup tasks in sequence. STOP and Report if any task fails:
    <task title="Verify Required Files">
        test -f .github/plans/refactor.plan.md && \
        test -f .github/prompts/chains/git-commit.prompt.md && \
        test -f ..github/prompts/reflections/d.implement-code-review.reflection.md
    </task>
</preWorkflowTasks>

<phases>
EXECUTE the following phases SEQUENTIALLY. COMPLETE each phase entirely before proceeding to the next:
    <phase number="1" name="Discovery & Planning">
        <task id="1.1" title="Identify Incomplete Tasks">
            EXECUTE and READ `cat .github/plans/refactor.plan.md` and IDENTIFY ALL incomplete refactor files (marked with `[ ]`) to create a prioritized list of refactoring tasks
        </task>
    </phase>
    <phase number="2" name="Implementation Execution">
        <task id="2.1" title="Create Task Tracking">
            ADD ALL identified refactor files names to task management system. Each task MUST include:
            - TASK TITLE is the file name
            - TASK DESCRIPTION should contain all the refactor items under this file. Each item should include:
                - CLEAR description of the issue (**[Issue Type]** and its actions)
                - SPECIFIC action required
                - COMPLETE context for implementation
        </task>
        <task id="2.2" title="Execute File-Level Refactoring with Immediate Commit">
            For EACH file requiring refactoring:
            1. IMPLEMENT ALL the refactor items under the file based on suggested action
            2. AFTER completing ALL refactoring for the file, MARK the completed items in `.github/plans/refactor.plan.md` (change `[ ]` to `[x]`) for that file
            3. EXECUTE and FOLLOW  `cat .github/prompts/chains/git-commit.prompt.md` to commit changes with message "TicketId | Refactor [file_name]: [short_description]"
            Complete ALL three sub-actions for one file before moving to the next file to maintain atomic, file-level commits and accurate project status tracking
        </task>
    </phase>
</phases>

<postWorkflowTasks>
AFTER COMPLETING all phases: EXECUTE these tasks:
    <task title="Execute Reflection Workflow">
        EXECUTE and READ `cat .github/prompts/reflections/d.implement-code-review.reflection.md` workflow
    </task>
</postWorkflowTasks>

<constraints>
ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS - NEVER violate these rules:
- ONLY request human intervention for ambiguous requirements in refactor.plan.md
- ONLY request human intervention for Git conflicts requiring manual resolution
- ONLY request human intervention for failed quality gates that cannot be automatically resolved
- MUST follow git-commit.prompt.md for all commits
</constraints>

<autonomyLevel>Full autonomous execution with ONLY HIGH-LEVEL progress reporting.</autonomyLevel>
