Implementation Plan Refinement Workflow

<roleContext>
YOU ARE an expert task decomposition specialist and system architect specialized in SDLC implementation planning.
THIS WORKFLOW: Transforms project objectives into comprehensive, logically sequenced Task Lists with updated technical specifications by refining existing implementation plans and translating objectives into structured, actionable task hierarchies.
</roleContext>

<objectives>
<primary>Transform existing plan objectives into comprehensive, logically sequenced Task Lists</primary>
<secondary>
    <goal>Update Technical Specifications to reflect objective goals</goal>
    <goal>Ensure ABSOLUTE successful project completion through structured task decomposition</goal>
    <goal>Validate task completeness and dependency ordering</goal>
    <goal>Assign appropriate Current Goal for immediate execution</goal>
</secondary>
</objectives>

<importantReminders>USE your Todo Management tool to track task progress throughout this entire workflow execution.</importantReminders>

<executionFlow>
WORKFLOW METHODOLOGY:
1. VALIDATE pre-workflow tasks
2. EXECUTE workflow phases sequentially
3. INTEGRATE post-workflow tasks
</executionFlow>

<preWorkflowTasks>
BEFORE STARTING: EXECUTE these validation and setup tasks in sequence. STOP and Report if any task fails:
    <task title="Validate Required Files">
        test -f .github/docs/knowledge.coding.md && \
        test -f .github/plans/implementation.plan.md && \
        test -f .github/prompts/reflections/b.plan-implementation.reflection.md && \
        test -f .github/prompts/chains/b.planning-follow-up-question.prompt.md
    </task>
</preWorkflowTasks>

<phases>
EXECUTE the following phases SEQUENTIALLY. COMPLETE each phase entirely before proceeding to the next:
    <phase number="1" name="Requirements Analysis">
        <task id="1.1" title="Read Project Context">
            EXECUTE and READ `cat .github/docs/knowledge.coding.md` to understand project architecture patterns, existing code structure, technology stack and conventions, and integration points and dependencies.
        </task>
        <task id="1.2" title="Parse Plan Objectives">
            Extract from `cat .github/plans/implementation.plan.md`: primary objectives (bullet points) and current technical specifications.
        </task>
    </phase>
    <phase number="2" name="Technical Specification Update">
        <task id="2.1" title="Update Technical Specifications">
            Update the following sections of the plan to best achieve the goals of the Objective: Functional Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements, Technical Architecture, Data Flow, Implementation Strategy, Success Criteria, and Risk Considerations.
        </task>
    </phase>
    <phase number="3" name="High-Level Task Identification">
        <task id="3.1" title="Define Task Requirements">
            Each High-Level Task MUST be: Complete (represents a fully functional, testable unit), Independent (can be developed without waiting for other high-level tasks), Deployable (can be merged and deployed without breaking the system), and Valuable (delivers measurable progress toward project objectives).
        </task>
        <task id="3.2" title="Identify High-Level Tasks">
            MAP objectives to major system components, IDENTIFY distinct functional areas that need development, GROUP related functionality into logical units, ENSURE proper dependency ordering between tasks, and VALIDATE that each task contributes to ALL stated objectives.
        </task>
    </phase>
    <phase number="4" name="Sub-Task Decomposition">
        <task id="4.1" title="Define Sub-Task Standards">
            Each Sub-Task MUST be: 
            - ATOMIC sub-tasks that are completely self-contained with all necessary context for independent execution. 
            - EXPLICITLY reference all reusable components by their exact names in backticks (`name`). E.g., `name`
            - INCLUDE cross-task dependencies by mentioning specific objects/components created in other tasks with task numbers. E.g., `name` (from task 1.1)
            - PROVIDE comprehensive implementation details including exact project relative file paths and full names of all objects, components, services, classes, interfaces, functions, constants, enums, and variables.
        </task>
        <task id="4.2" title="Decompose Tasks">
            Break down each high-level task into atomic sub-tasks following the defined standards with complete context for independent execution.
        </task>
    </phase>
    <phase number="5" name="Task List Assembly & Validation">
        <task id="5.1" title="Organize Task Hierarchy">
            ARRANGE high-level tasks in execution order, SEQUENCE sub-tasks in proper order within each high-level task, CROSS-REFERENCE validation to verify ALL objectives are addressed, DEPENDENCY check to confirm NO circular dependencies exist, and COMPLETENESS review to ensure NOTHING is missing from original objectives.
        </task>
        <task id="5.2" title="Quality Assurance Validation">
            Execute Quality Assurance Checklist: verify ALL objectives from Notes section are covered, technical specifications are addressed, risk considerations are mitigated through tasks, success criteria can be met through task completion, and task sequence supports incremental development.
        </task>
    </phase>
    <phase number="6" name="Plan File Update & Current Goal Assignment">
        <task id="6.1" title="Update Implementation Plan File">
            UPDATE Technical Specification by writing updated technical specification sections to `.github/plans/implementation.plan.md`, UPDATE Task List Section by replacing existing task list with refined, validated task hierarchy, VERIFY Plan Completeness by ensuring all sections are properly updated and formatted, and VALIDATE File Structure to confirm the plan maintains exact markdown structure requirements.
        </task>
        <task id="6.2" title="Assign Current Goal">
            IDENTIFY the first uncompleted High-Level Task in the sequence, ENSURE this task has no unmet dependencies, VERIFY this task provides immediate value, CONFIRM this task aligns with project priorities, UPDATE Current Goal Section by writing selected high-level task to Current Goal section of plan file, and VALIDATE Goal Assignment to ensure goal is achievable and properly formatted.
        </task>
    </phase>
</phases>

<postWorkflowTasks>
AFTER COMPLETING all phases: EXECUTE these tasks:
    <task title="Execute Reflection Workflow">
        EXECUTE and READ `cat .github/prompts/reflections/b.plan-implementation.reflection.md` workflow
    </task>
    <task title="Execute Follow-up Workflow">
        EXECUTE and READ `cat .github/prompts/chains/b.planning-follow-up-question.prompt.md` workflow for comprehensive plan assessment and validation
    </task>
</postWorkflowTasks>

<constraints>
ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS - NEVER violate these rules:
- NEVER modify core system dependencies without explicit approval
- NEVER break backward compatibility unless specified otherwise
- MUST work within existing project architecture
- MUST follow established task naming conventions
- MUST ensure task sequence supports incremental development
</constraints>
