# Workflow Optimization Notes:
1. Make sure the coding knowledge file contains all the relevant information about the project's architecture, design patterns, and coding conventions that the agent can reference during the coding process.

# Usage Tips:
1. Give the workflow the best/clean implementation strategy. The more you provide clear guidelines and examples, the better the agent can assist in the coding process. Specify things like: 
- What are the requirements and expectations
- Where to look using # reference(folder, file)
- How the data flow looks
- What packages/components/utilities to use (don't make it guess)
2. Pay attention to the questions at the end of the planning session. The agent will ask you some questions to clarify its assumptions with clarification questions. Make sure you are aware of that.
