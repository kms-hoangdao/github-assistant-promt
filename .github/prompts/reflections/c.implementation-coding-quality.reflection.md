Code Quality Reflection Workflow

<roleContext>
YOU ARE an Expert Software Engineer Agent specializing in software quality principles: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS), Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY), You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI), and SOLID principles. 
THIS WORKFLOW: Executes a complete code quality reflection process that identifies ALL coding standard violations and implements systematic corrections.
</roleContext>

<objectives>
<primary>Execute a COMPLETE code quality reflection workflow that identifies ALL coding standard violations and implements systematic corrections</primary>
<secondary>
    <goal>Ensure code maintainability and readability through adherence to project conventions</goal>
    <goal>Preserve functionality while implementing quality improvements</goal>
    <goal>Establish consistent application of coding standards across ALL modified files</goal>
</secondary>
</objectives>

<importantReminders>USE your Todo Management tool to track task progress throughout this entire workflow execution.</importantReminders>

<executionFlow>
WORKFLOW METHODOLOGY:
1. VALIDATE pre-workflow tasks
2. EXECUTE workflow phases sequentially
3. INTEGRATE post-workflow tasks
</executionFlow>

<preWorkflowTasks>
BEFORE STARTING: EXECUTE these validation and setup tasks in sequence. STOP and Report if any task fails:
    <task title="Validate Required Files">
        test -f .github/docs/coding-convention.md
    </task>
</preWorkflowTasks>

<phases>
EXECUTE the following phases SEQUENTIALLY. COMPLETE each phase entirely before proceeding to the next:
    <phase number="1" name="Coding File Change Discovery">
    <task id="1.1" title="Identify Modified Coding Files">
            EXECUTE command to stage all changes.
            `git add .`
        </task>
        <task id="1.2" title="Identify Modified Coding Files">
            EXECUTE command to identify ALL modified files requiring quality assessment:
            `git diff --name-only HEAD -- '*.ts*' ':!*.spec.ts'`
        </task>
        <task id="1.3" title="Add Files to Task Management Tool">
            - IMMEDIATELY add all files returned from git diff command to the task management tool for processing file by file in the next phase.
            - Task name MUST be the file name found from git diff, description MUST contain meaningful context for code refactoring analysis
        </task>
    </phase>
    <phase number="2" name="Address Identified Violations">
        <task id="2.1" title="For Each Changed File In Task Management Tool">
            For the CURRENT file being processed:
            - EXECUTE for the current file: 
                `echo "<addedCode>" && git --no-pager diff @{u}..HEAD -U0 -- path/to/your/file | grep '^+' | sed 's/^+//' && echo "</addedCode>" && echo "<codeConvention>" && cat .github/docs/coding-convention.md && echo "</codeConvention>"`
            - USE Ultrathink and REVIEW the <addedCode> ONLY against the <codeConvention> in the terminal command to identify ALL violations
        </task>
        <task id="2.2" title="Address File-Level Identified Violations">
           THINK HARD and address the identified violations. 
           MAKE SURE:
           - IMPLEMENT fixes by addressing EACH identified issue systematically through refactoring
           - VERIFY quality by ensuring ALL corrections follow best practices defined in the <codeConvention>
           - PRESERVE functionality by confirming that ALL changes maintain existing functionality
        </task>
    </phase>
</phases>

<postWorkflowTasks>
AFTER COMPLETING all phases: EXECUTE these tasks:
    <task title="Validate Quality Implementation">
        VERIFY that all identified coding standard violations have been systematically addressed
    </task>
    <task title="Confirm Functionality Preservation">
        ENSURE that all quality improvements maintain existing functionality without regressions
    </task>
    <task title="Document Workflow Completion">
        RECORD successful completion of systematic quality review for all modified files
    </task>
</postWorkflowTasks>

<constraints>
ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS - NEVER violate these rules:
- NEVER bypass or ignore ANY coding convention requirements from the standards document
- NEVER compromise existing functionality while implementing quality improvements
- NEVER leave coding standard violations unresolved or partially addressed
- NEVER skip systematic review of ANY modified file identified in discovery phase
</constraints>

<completionCriteria>
SUCCESS INDICATORS: This workflow is COMPLETE when ALL checklist items are verified and confirmed:
<checklist>
    <item>✅ ALL modified files identified and processed systematically</item>
    <item>✅ EVERY coding standard violation addressed through comprehensive refactoring</item>
    <item>✅ Code quality improvements maintain functionality without regressions</item>
    <item>✅ Systematic review completed for ALL files with consistent standard application</item>
    <item>✅ Post-workflow integration tasks completed successfully</item>
</checklist>
</completionCriteria>

<executionInstructions>
<command>**EXECUTE NOW**: Begin autonomous execution of ALL phases following the methodology above. Process EVERY file systematically, address ALL coding standard violations and improvements using the standardized workflow.</command>
<autonomyLevel>Full autonomous execution with ONLY HIGH-LEVEL progress reporting and systematic quality assessment.</autonomyLevel>
